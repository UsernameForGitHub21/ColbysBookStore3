I am attempting to rebuild my assignment after an error that occured again

6:22
I've created the project, commented out the port, made a github repository, and tested to make sure it opens

6:25
changed the contents out bootsrap.css and site.css

6:28
Changed the contents of Layout.cshtml, I didn't remove "text-dark" from line 23 because in mine it didnt have any

6:31
removed text-dark from LoginPartial.cshtml and tested my website, everything looks good so far

6:35
Added links, stylesheets, and dropdown to layout.schtml
*** IMPOTANT - I need to get the rest of line 34, it is cut off in the slideshow - IMPORTANT *****

6:45
Created projects

6:55
Added all needed Frameworks

7:00
After a bit of debugging, my assignment now runs

7:12
***** EROOR *****
moved models into the project, I have an error in Views/Shared/Error.cshtml that says the type or namespace VeiwErrorModel cannot be found
in the slide show it shows them solving this by adding to the main project, project refences to the others but I have done this and I still have an error.
